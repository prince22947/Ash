=== PART 3: Server Protection & Onboarding ===
Slash Commands:
/protection enable|disable  — toggle bad-word filtering; creates per-server log channel
/setupjoin #channel [member_role] [bot_role]  — set welcome channel; create roles if missing
/autorole [member_role] [bot_role]  — update auto-assigned roles later
/lock [#channel]  — lock a channel (Manage Channels required)

Behavior:
- Filtering active only after /protection enable
- Incidents logged to #ash-logs (one per server)
- Level 3 bad words send DM warnings; no kicks/bans
- Auto role on join: bots → Bot role, members → Member role
- Configuration saved to music/bot_data.json (persists after restart)
- Welcome message sent in the configured channel
